====URGENT====

*: Squirrel's compile time error handler does not print. Invalid parameters in functions does print an error, and normal print statements work as well.



====NORMAL====

*: When increasing the window size, a letterbox appears that interferes with getting the mouse coordinates. Need a way to get the coords of the letterbox and subtract it when calculating mouse coords.

*: Maximizing the window on Pandora makes SDL lose the ability to draw.
