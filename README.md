### **Introduction**

XYG Studio is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime-based game development kit using the Squirrel language. The aim is to make development both easy and versatile, allowing games to be written by hand in a simple text editor or made in an IDE similar to Game Maker, and to allow games to be ported with little to no modification to the code.
